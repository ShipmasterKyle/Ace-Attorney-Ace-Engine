Sahwit;I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.;Normal;Witness;
Sahwit;I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.; ; ;
Sawhit;Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.; ; ;
Sawhit;Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!; ; ;
Sawhit;I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.; ; ;
Sawhit;I thought to call the police immediately!; ; ;
Sawhit;However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.; ; ;
Sawhit;I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.; ; ;
Sawhit;I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.; ; ;
Sawhit;The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.; ; ;

Judge;Hmm...;Serious; ; ;
PhoenixC;(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!);Sweating;Defense;
Judge;Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?;Serious;Judge;
Payne;Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.;Normal;Prosecution;
Judge;Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?;Serious;Judge;
Payne;Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally.;Normal;Prosecution;
Payne;The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.; ; ;

Phoenix;Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?; ; ;
MiaC;Why, you expose the/lies\in the testimony the witness just gave!; ; ;
Phoenix;Lies! What?! He was lying!?; ; ;
MiaC;Your client is innocent, right?; ; ;
MiaC;Then that witness must have lied in his testimony!; ; ;
MiaC;Or is your client really... guilty?; ; ;
Phoenix;!!! How do I prove he's not?;; ; ;
Mia;You hold the key! It's in the evidence!; ; ;
Mia;Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!; ; ;

PhoenixC;You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?;Thinking;Defense;

PhoenixC;Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report.;Smug;Defense;
PhoenixC;The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM.;Document;Defense;
PhoenixC;There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?;Smug; ;
Sahwit;!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...;Panic;Witness;
--Payne Objection
Payne;This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!; ;Prosecution;

Sahwit;I.. er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!; ;Witness;
Mia;Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot!; ;Co;

PhoenixC;Just answer the question, Mr. Sahwit.;Normal;Defense;

Judge;Yes, Mr. Payne?;Serious;Judge;
Payne;As the witness stated, this statue is indeed a clock. The neck is a switch.;Normal;Prosecution;
Payne;You just tilt it, and it says the time out loud. As it doesn't look like a clock, I submitted it as a statue. My apologies.; ; ;
Judge;I see. So the murder weapon was a table clock after all.;Normal;Judge;
Judge;Well, Mr. Wright? It appears that the witness's testimony was correct. This is a clock.;Serious; ;
Judge;Do you have any problems with his testimony now?; ;Ask;
PhoenixC;The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand.;Thinking;Defense;
PhoenixC;Yet the witness testified that he never entered the apartment! Clearly, a contradiction!;Pointing; ;
Judge;Hmm... indeed!;Normal;Judge;
PhoenixC;The witness knew it was a clock, because he...;Thinking;Ask;
PhoenixC;You're lying! You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!;Pointing;Defense;
Sahwit;Oh yeah? Prove it! Prove I went in there!;Smug;Witness;
PhoenixC;I'll do better than that! I can prove you were the one who killed her!;Pointing;Defense;

Judge;Order in the court! Intriguing. Please continue, Mr. Wright.;Serious;Judge;
PhoenixC;Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Sahwit. The sound must have left quite an impression on you.;Thinking;Defense;

PhoenixC;That voice was burned into your mind. That's why you were so certain about the time!; ; ;

PhoenixC;Your Honor?;Normal;Defense;
Judge;You claim the sound the witness heard came from the clock... Do you have any evidence?;Serious;Judge;

PhoenixC;Mr. Payne... can you tell me what time it is now?;Smug;Defense;
Payne;It's 11:25... Ack!;Suprised;Prosecution;
PhoenixC;As you can see, this clock is exactly three hours slow! Precisely the discrepancy between what Mr. Sahwit heard and the actual time of death!;Document;Defense;
PhoenixC;So, Mr. Sahwit... Try to talk your way out of this one!;Smug; ;
Sahwit;... ...Hah! Hah hah! You forgot one thing!; ;Witness;
PhoenixC;(Uh oh... what's he talking about...?);Sweating;Defense;
Sahwit;While it may seem like that clock IS running three hours slow... It proves nothing!; ;Witness;
Sahwit;How do you know it was running three days slow on the day of the murder!? If you can't prove that, you don't have a case!; ;Witness;
PhoenixC;...! (He's right! How am I going to prove that!? Dammit! I was so close!);Suprised;Defense;
Judge;Mr. Wright? It seems you lack the critical evidence to support your claim.;Serious;Judge;
PhoenixC;...! Yes, Your Honor.;Normal;Defense;
Judge;This means I cannot let you indict the witness. Unfortunately... This ends the cross-examination of Mr. Frank Sahwit.;Serious;Judge;

MiaC;Um... well, yes. But that doesn't mean you can't still win! Try thinking out of the box! Don't waste time doubting the facts.; ; ;
MiaC;Assume the clock was three hours slow and... Think through it! Ask yourself,/"Why was the clock three hours slow"?\; ; ;
MiaC;Figure out the reason, and you'll have your proof! Right, Wright? Can you think of a reason as to why the clock would be three hours slow?; ;Ask;
Judge;Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!;Serious;Judge;
PhoenixC;The victim had just returned home from abroad the day before the murder. As we all know, the time difference between here and Paris is nine hours!;Document;Defense;
PhoenixC;When it's 4:00 PM here, it's 1:00 AM the next day there. The clock wasn't three hours slow, it was nine hours fast!;Document; ;
PhoenixC;The victim hadn't reset her clock since returning home! That's why the time you heard when you struck her dead in her apartment was wrong!;Smug; ;

Mia;Wright? I hope you see the importance of evidence now. Also, hopefully you realize, things change depending on how you look at them. People, too. We never really know if our clients are guilty or innocent.; ; ;
Mia;All we can do is believe in them. And in order to believe in them, you have to believe in yourself. Wright... Listen. Learn. Grow strong. Never let go of what you believe in. Never.; ; ;
Mia;Well, I think our work here is done! Shall we be off?; ; ;
Phoenix;Yeah, I guess so!; ; ;
Mia;Say, how about dinner. On me? We'll drink a toast to innocent Butz!; ; ;
Phoenix;Yeah!; ; ;
Mia;Oh, speaking of Harry... You were saying part of why you became a lawyer was because of him.; ; ;
Phoenix;Er, yeah. Part, at least.; ; ;
Mia;You'll have to tell me more about it sometime! Maybe... over drinks?; ; ;
